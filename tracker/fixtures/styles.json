Peat smoked malts are used in many other styles, like Scotch Ales in a liberal way though many American brewers use more typically in Porters. The flavor of peat smoke tends to be much stronger and more assertive so brewers use very modest amounts in the mash."}}, {"pk": 99, "model": "tracker.style", "fields": {"lowabv": "8.0", "name": "Tripel", "highabv": "12.0", "description": "The name \"Tripel\" actually stems from part of the brewing process, in which brewers use up to three times the amount of malt than a standard Trappist \"Simple.\" Traditionally, Tripels are bright yellow to gold in color, which is a shade or two darker than the average Pilsener. Head should be big, dense and creamy. Aroma and flavor runs along complex, spicy phenolic, powdery yeast, fruity/estery with a sweet finish. Sweetness comes from both the pale malts and the higher alcohol. Bitterness is up there for a beer with such a light body for its strength, but at times is barely perceived amongst the even balance of malts and hops. The lighter body comes from the use of Belgian candy sugar (up to 25% sucrose), which not only lightens the body, but also adds complex alcoholic aromas and flavors. Small amounts of spices are sometimes added as well. <br> <br>Tripels are actually notoriously alcoholic, yet the best crafted ones hide this character quite evil-like and deceivingly, making them sipping beers."}}, {"pk": 100, "model": "tracker.style", "fields": {"lowabv": "3.5", "name": "Vienna Lager", "highabv": "6.5", "description": "Named after the city in which it orginated, a traditional Vienna lager is brewed using a three step decoction boiling process. Munich, Pilsner, Vienna toasted and dextrin malts are used, as well wheat in some cases. Subtle hops, crisp, with residual sweetness. <br> <br>Although German in origin and rare these days, some classic examples come from Mexico, such as: Dos Equis and Negra Modelo. A result of late 19th century immigrant brewers from Austria."}}, {"pk": 101, "model": "tracker.style", "fields": {"lowabv": "7.0", "name": "Weizenbock", "highabv": "10.0", "description": "A more powerful Dunkel Weizen (of \"bock strength\"), with a pronounced estery alcohol character, perhaps some spiciness from this, and bolder and more complex malt characters of dark fruits."}}, {"pk": 102, "model": "tracker.style", "fields": {"lowabv": "9.0", "name": "Wheatwine", "highabv": "14.0", "description": "A somewhat recent and over-looked American strong ale, the Wheatwine (or Wheat Wine) is akin to a Barleywine in strength, but contains a large portion of wheat malt; upwards of 50%. The wheat provides a soft and fluffy mouthfeel. Color and bitterness varies."}}, {"pk": 103, "model": "tracker.style", "fields": {"lowabv": "5.5", "name": "Winter Warmer", "highabv": "8.0", "description": "These malty sweet offerings tend to be a favorite winter seasonal.

Alcohol warmth is not uncommon. <br> <br>Many English versions contain no spices, though some brewers of spiced winter seasonal ales will slap \"Winter Warmer\" on the label. Those that are spiced, tend to follow the \"wassail\" tradition of blending robust ales with mixed spices, before hops became the chief \"spice\" in beer. American varieties many have a larger presences of hops both in bitterness and flavor."}}, {"pk": 104, "model": "tracker.style", "fields": {"lowabv": "4.0", "name": "Witbier", "highabv": "7.0", "description": "A Belgian Style ale that's very pale and cloudy in appearance due to it being unfiltered and the high level of wheat, and sometimes oats, that's used in the mash. Always spiced, generally with coriander, orange peel and other oddball spices or herbs in the back ground. The crispness and slight twang comes from the wheat and the lively level of carbonation. This is one style that many brewers in the US have taken a liking to and have done a very good job of staying to style. Sometimes served with a lemon, but if you truly want to enjoy the untainted subtleties of this style you'll ask for yours without one. Often referred to as \"white beers\" (witbieren) due to the cloudiness / yeast in suspension."}}]
